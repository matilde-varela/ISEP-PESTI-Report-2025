  Abstract  = {Kanban methodology is a very significant philosophy 
               which plays an important role in many production units. 
               In this paper, Kanban methodology has been reviewed 
               and has been implemented on ‘Swing Lever Assembly’ 
               of the Bajaj Steels Pvt. Ltd Nagpur. The Kanban system 
               involves the selection of two important parameters, i.e., 
               the lot size and the number of Kanbans used in the process. 
               The main objective of the Kanban system is to maximize 
               the productivity of a unit, and this is done by reducing the 
               idle time of the process. The Kanban system is a very 
               cost-efficient process if applied in a proper manner.},

    Abstract = {Agile Methods are creating a buzz in the software development community, drawing their fair share of advocates and opponents. While some people consider agile methods the best thing that has happened to software development in recent years, other people view them as a backlash to software engineering and compare them to hacking. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to agile methods allowing him/her to judge whether or not agile methods could be useful in modern software development. The chapter discusses the history behind agile methods as well as the agile manifesto, a statement from the leaders of the agile movement. It looks at what it means to be agile, discusses the role of management, describes and compares some of the more popular agile methods, provides a guide for deciding where an agile approach is applicable, and lists common criticisms. It summarizes empirical studies, anecdotal reports, and lessons learned from applying agile methods and concludes with an analysis of various agile methods. The target audiences for this chapter include practitioners, who will be interested in the discussion of the different methods and their applications, researchers who may want to focus on the empirical studies and lessons learned, and educators looking to teach and learn more about agile methods.},

@article{Pollman2024,
   abstract = {ESG is one of the most notable trends in corporate governance, management, and investment of the past two decades. It is at the center of the largest and most contentious debates in contemporary corporate and securities law. Yet few observers know where the term comes from, who coined it, and what it was originally aimed to mean and achieve. As trillions of dollars have flowed into ESG-labeled investment products, and companies and regulators have grappled with ESG policies , a variety of usages of the term have developed that range from seemingly neutral concepts of integrating "environmental, social, and governance" issues into investment analysis to value-laden notions of corporate social responsibility or preferences for what some have characterized as "conscious" or "woke" capitalism. This Article makes three contributions. First, it provides a history of the term ESG that was coined without precise definition in a collaboration between the United Nations and major players in the financial industry. Understanding this history reveals that key normative choices between promoting shareholder value, limiting corporate externalities, or creating some other social good were not definitively determined in creating the term ESG. Second, the Article identifies and examines the main usages of the term ESG that have developed since its origins. ESG takes on dramatically different meanings varying from factors for integrating in investment analysis or risk management to a synonym for corporate social responsibility, sustainability, or even an ideological preference or political stance provoking backlash. Third, the Article offers an analytical critique of the term ESG and its consequences. It argues that the combination of E, S, and G into one term has provided a highly flexible moniker that can vary widely by context, evolve over time, and collectively appeal to a broad range of investors and stakeholders. These features both help to account for global spread of the term ESG, but also challenges related to the term such as the difficulty of empirically showing a causal relationship between ESG and financial performance, a proliferation of ratings that can seem at odds with understood purposes of ESG, and "sustainability arbitrage." These challenges fuel critics who assert that ESG engenders confusion and fosters unrealistic expectations and greenwashing that could inhibit corporate accountability or crowd out other solutions to pressing environmental and social issues. These critiques are intertwined with the characteristic flexibility and unfixed definition of ESG that were present from the beginning and ultimately shed light on obstacles for the future of the ESG movement and regulatory reform.},

   abstract = {The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is the largest global ESG initiative in the asset management industry to date. We analyze what happens after active US mutual funds sign the PRI, to assess whether they exhibit ESG implementation. We find that PRI signatories attract a large fund inflow but we do not observe improvements in fund-level ESG scores or fund returns. We consider a battery of ways to proxy for funds' ESG incorporation (e.g., entry/exit, screening, engagement, voting for pro-ESG proposals), but fail to observe evidence of meaningful follow-through, on average. Next, we explore cross-sectional fund characteristics and find that only quant-funds exhibit small improvement in ESG performance versus other funds, mainly through buying high-ESG-performing stocks. Furthermore, we note that PRI signatories are not superior performers in ESG issues prior to signing, relative to non-PRI funds, but PRI affiliation tends to be widely advertised on company websites, marketing materials, and fund documents. Overall, a reasonable reader may perceive our findings as consistent with PRI funds' greenwashing. We note, however, that what we uncover is based only on outcome-based measures and may miss some actual efforts of signatories. JEL classification codes: G20},

   abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to clarify the impact mechanisms and weighting factors of environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices on corporate value through bibliometric analysis and core interpretation of existing literature, further explore whether and under what conditions ESG practices contribute to the corporate value creation, and provide an outlook on future research directions. Design/methodology/approach: Bibliometric method is used to analyze literature co-citation, burst detection and keyword co-occurrence, and literature review method is used to condense important ideas from the existing literature. Findings: Through the review, analysis and summary of the existing literature, this paper finds that the perspectives of risk, information and strategy reflect the key pathways through which ESG practices play a role in avoiding harm and creating value for companies directly or indirectly. Macro, meso and micro factors moderate the direction and extent of the impact. Moreover, considering the relationship between ESG performance and ESG disclosure is key to understanding some contradictory findings. Research limitations/implications: The search terms limit the articles considered, and therefore, the research framework may be incomplete. Moreover, this article is primarily aimed at the research field and lacks guidance at the practical level. Practical implications: This paper helps the academic community to deepen its understanding of ESG, moving beyond the question of whether ESG is linked to corporate value to further understand why and under what conditions ESG practices create value for firms. Social implications: This paper has great practical significance in motivating companies to actively participate in ESG practices. Originality/value: The theoretical framework in this paper reveals the black box between enterprise ESG practices and value creation, and clarifies the research boundary of “the relationship between ESG practices and value creation,” contributing to the future research in this field.},

We provide evidence that the total ESG score is diminishing for the S \& P500 firms from 2019 till 2021 meaning that these risks factors take their rightful place in the global economy. We find that the impact of environmental risks on the firm’s valuation is not significant enough. Moreover, we found that while the “Beta” risk factor of the S \& P500 carries environmental risks, it does not hold such risks for Nasdaq100 stocks, and therefore, we recommend strengthening the environmental education to investors and other financial industry participants. This research also provides evidence that social risk impact negatively the simple excess return for both the S \& P500 and nasdaq100 stocks indicating 
that social issues must be mitigated in order to maximize a firm value. Moreover, we find that the traditional CAPM “Beta” carries environmental and corporate governance risks for the S \& P500 stocks. However, it totally neglects social risks and therefore it can not be used in modern ages where social risk are very important to all participants of the global

We document the rating divergence and map the different methodologies onto a common taxonomy of categories. Using this taxonomy, we decompose the divergence into contributions of scope, measurement, and weight. Measurement contributes 56\% of the divergence, scope 38\%, and weight 6\%. Further analyzing the reasons for measurement divergence, we detect a rater effect where a rater’s overall view of a firm influences the measurement of specific categories.

Most established frameworks face difficulties and challenges in providing sustainability information to investors in a significant way, lacking in areas such as transparency, reliability, consistency, materiality, and particularly, their focus on the “S” dimension of ESG. The present article purposes to review the challenges associated with several frameworks and to present a solution to overcome them, by giving an overview of a new and innovative software as a service framework, ESG Maturity. This software presents itself as a solution for both reporting companies and their respective investors, by providing both with an assessment of the ESG maturity index of the companies, and delivering a report containing relevant initiatives, strategies, and action plans tailored to each one of them, within different sectors, dimensions, and geographic areas and consequently, their financial and non-financial implementation impact. ESG Maturity is considered a possible answer to the challenges in ESG reporting, having the potential to revolutionize the way companies report their non-financial information and how investors receive it.},

We identify two channels through which digitization affects ESG performance. First, digitization enables companies to reduce agency costs and increase governance (G) scores. Second, digitization facilitates companies to improve goodwill and further increase social (S) scores. However, we do not find that digitization improves companies’ environmental (E) scores.

Although a few studies have investigated the role of individual technologies (e.g., blockchain) in ESG, applying a broader set of emerging technologies in improving ESG disclosure and addressing its limitations is yet to be explored. Industry 5.0 offers a powerful framework for understanding the role of technologies in enhancing ESG disclosure. This conceptual paper explains ESG from the lens of management theories and views, including stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, transaction cost economics theory, institutional theory, signaling theory, network economics theory, and the decoupling view. It then explores the application of I5.0 in enhancing ESG disclosure. The underlying values of I5.0 align with those of ESG, and I5.0 can support ESG functionalities. I5.0 is particularly useful in enhancing ESG disclosure authenticity, extending ESG disclosure from retrospective to prospective and real-time reporting, customizing ESG reports, extending the scope of reporting to multi-tier supply chains, reducing ESG cost, and enhancing the overall efficacy of ESG disclosure. The paper also sheds light on governance aspects, challenges, and risks of employing I5.0 to ESG.},

   abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing area of research that encompasses numerical methods to solve various prediction, optimization, and classification/clustering problems. Recently, AI tools were proposed to address the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) challenges associated with sustainable business development. While many publications discuss the potential of AI, few focus on practical cases in the three ESG domains altogether, and even fewer highlight the challenges that AI may pose in terms of ESG. The current paper fills this gap by reviewing practical AI applications with a main focus on IT and engineering implementations. The considered cases are based on almost one hundred publicly available research manuscripts and reports obtained via online search engines. This review involves the study of typical business and production problems associated with each ESG domain, gives background details on several selected cases (such as carbon neutrality, land management, and ESG scoring), and lists challenges that the smart algorithms can pose (such as fake news generation and increased electricity consumption). Overall, it is concluded that, while many practical cases already exist, AI in ESG is still very far away from reaching its full potential; however, one should always remember that AI itself can lead to some ESG risks.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the current state of knowledge in key reporting aspects in relation to sustainability reporting in general and to reflect on their relevance to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in particular. In doing so, the major gaps in that knowledge are identified, and the paper proceeds to suggest further research avenues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a review of papers published in leading journals concerning sustainability reporting to analyse the progress in the literature regarding three important reporting topics: materiality, comparability and assurance. Findings: The review conducted in this study shows that there is still work to be done to ensure high-quality and consistent sustainability reporting. Key takeaways from the review of the extant literature are as follows: there is ongoing debate about the nature of sustainability reporting materiality, and single versus double materiality. Clearer guidance and better contextualisation are seen as essential for comparability, and, as GRI suggests, there is an important link to materiality that needs to be considered. Finally, assurance has not been mandatory under the GRI, but the current development at EU level might lead to the GRI principles being incorporated in the primary assurance standards. Practical implications: In this paper, the authors review and synthesise the previous literature on GRI reporting dealing with three key reporting aspects. Social implications: The authors extract some takeaways from the literature on materiality, comparability and assurance that will all be key challenges for GRI in the future. Originality/value: This paper provides an updated review of the literature on GRI reporting dealing with three key reporting aspects.},

   abstract = {This is the authors version of a book chapter to be published later this year. Abstract This chapter discusses the development of GRI Standards and reviews recent research on practice and policy issues concerning their implementation. Six themes emerged in the literature published between 2010 and 2021: applicability of GRI Standards; nature of adoption of GRI Standards by report preparers; materiality assessment in GRI reporting; the level of understanding of GRI Standards; the voluntary status of GRI Standards and the need for mandatory reporting; and the quality of assurance. Research suggests that GRI Standards enhance: the comparability of sustainability reporting; the amount of information available on matters of concern to stakeholders; the identification of material issues; and the context relevance of information. However, the voluntary nature of GRI Standards means that firms tend to strategically disclose sustainability information to manage corporate reputation, therefore some firms fail to be accountable for material negative impacts. Researchers call for making GRI Standards mandatory and increasing the scope and uptake of external assurance. The chapter highlights areas for further research. This is the authors version of a book chapter to be published later this year.},

@article{Goswami2023,
   abstract = {The article presents a comparative analysis of the sustainability disclosures of four companies, each of adopted different voluntary nonfinancial reporting frameworks and standards, as introduced by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB), and Climate Disclosure Project (CDP). The case study highlights the way in which these frameworks and standards are applied by organizations from different sectors as well as underlining the multiplicity of overlapping voluntary nonfinancial or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting frameworks. Thus, the article provides contextual reasons for alignment (with GRI, IIRC, SASB, and CDP) toward a proposed comprehensive corporate reporting standard as will be drafted by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). All these frameworks and standards are designed with distinctive characteristics to satisfy the ESG information needs of stakeholders, especially those in the financial sector. Each framework and standard tries to position itself for niche identity within the voluntary ESG reporting domain. As a result, organizations adopt all of the available contemporary nonfinancial sustainability or ESG reporting frameworks and standards, in a blended format. Thus, they present all nonfinancial information as a buffet to gain legitimacy and confidence from all stakeholders. This new trend can be termed as a blended reporting format phenomenon. However, the study finds that reporting based on GRI is the most comprehensive, as it is designed to address the information expectations of all stakeholders. The study also found that the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) is an important normative institutional framework that is motivating companies to present sustainability information to cater to the decision-making information need of capital markets and investors, while the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) act as the most respected global moral sustainability compass. However, the question remains as to whether sustainability information should only be seen from the financially material perspective of capital markets or if it should be considered as economic, social, and ecological material information for all stakeholders.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to the emerging debate on materiality with novel and original insights about the managerial and theoretical implications related to the adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) as reporting standards. Furthermore, the paper will evaluate the main drivers that favor the combination of the two standards by companies to develop new knowledge about the hierarchical relationship between financial and sustainability materiality. Design/methodology/approach: Building on a sample of 2,046 US listed companies observed during the period 2017–2020, the research is conducted using quantitative methods. Multinomial logistic regressions are used to evaluate the differences between GRI and SASB’s adoption. Findings: The analysis highlights that financial and sustainability materiality are driven by different purposes. In detail, SASB’s adoption is driven by factors directly related to financial dynamics, while GRI’s adoption is influenced by the existence of corporate governance mechanisms inspired by sustainable and ethical principles. Furthermore, the last analysis reveals that the combination of the two standards is characterized by the predominance of sustainability materiality. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical study on the relationship between financial and sustainability materiality.},

This rapid growth in interest in social and environmental measurement and disclosure has led to a proliferation of different proposals by rating agencies and other organizations to measure the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance of companies, which has contributed to also create confusion. This study aims to shed some light on the current state of ESG measurement and disclosure by examining the evolution of business-related sustainability terms and their connotations; taking stock of existing European Union (EU) regulations and international sustainability frameworks from non-governmental organisations; analysing the evolution of the ESG rating market and main players; identifying, clarifying, and comparing current ESG ratings, metrics, and indices; and finally, elaborating on the challenges and recommendations that can be considered in future developments of ESG measurement and disclosure.},

Software designers can organize the description of their architectural decisions around these four views and then illustrate them with a few selected use cases, or scenarios, which constitute a fifth view. The architecture is partially evolved from these scenarios.The 4+1 View Model allows various stakeholders to find what they need in the software architecture. System engineers can approach it first from the physical view, then the process view; end users, customers, and data specialists can approach it from the logical view; and project managers and software-configuration staff members can approach it from the development view.},
